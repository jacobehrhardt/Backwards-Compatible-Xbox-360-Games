# Backwards-Compatible-Xbox-360-Games
My first script I created on the spot! Created this as a way to find out which of my old Xbox 360 games were backwards compatible, instead of sifting through all 653 listed on Xbox's website.

This scrit scrapes the name of each backwards compatible game from Xbox's website, along with its listed price, and organizes them in an Excel file.
